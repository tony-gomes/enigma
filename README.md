Self Assessment

Functionality: 2.5
The key generation still seems a bit quirky, and not completely stable. Testing assertions feel inadequate for
deep analysis of random key generation. The encrypt/decrypt processes work when fed key & date however.

OOP: 3
The use of modules seems better than encapsulating everything inside the Enigma class, but maybe inheritance would have
been wiser from an OOP perspective.

Ruby Conventions: 3
I follow Ruby convention & style like a brown belt giving 110% to go black.

TDD: 2.5
I followed TDD throughout the whole project, and made sure to test all methods, including modules.

Version Control: 2
I did not have the motivation to branch properly, and did not commit message like a champ this go around.
